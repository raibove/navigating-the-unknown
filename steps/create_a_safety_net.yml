learningObjectives: 
- Implementing a 404 page to catch any broken links or missing pages.
hints:
- Create a new component that let users know that the page they are trying to visit does not exist.
- Use react-router-dom to handle the 404 page.

But don't worry, there are plenty of other cool items to choose from in the Anythink marketplace. Take a look around and find something new!_ "
